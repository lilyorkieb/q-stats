# q-stats
why did Q say it was statistically impossible for the number of delta 0's between him and trump? Q was purposely misleading people. the number of delta 0's fall perfectly in line with the rest of the deltas (from 0 - 120). there was no statistical significance to the delta 0's at all. check for urself. this data was pulled around the same time Q used the words "statistically impossible"... see here: https://qalerts.app/?q=statistically
